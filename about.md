I am an assistant professor in computer science at Washington State University (WSU). 
My academic interests include both teaching and researching cybersecurity, specifically 
for the smart grid, critical infrastructure, and other cyber-physical systems.

Iâ€™m originally from Iowa and did my undergraduate and graduate work at the University 
of Northern Iowa and Iowa State University respectively. Between then and here I worked 
at the MITRE Corporation, primarily doing cybersecurity testing and researching 
cyber-physical system security.
