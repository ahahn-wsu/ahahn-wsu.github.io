## Projects
### Attack Surface Analysis Tools
Develop theoretical metrics for system attacks surface to model the complex interdependencies in critical power grid control systems, such as SCADA servers and distribution management systems.
Prototype code can be found [here](https://github.com/ESIC-DA/AHA-Scraper)

### Trusted Execution Environments for CPS
This explore techniques to secure cyber-physical systems through Trusted Execution Environments (TEE), which enable improved detection of key system functions and data.

Prototype code can be found [here](https://github.com/wsu-smartcity/InverterCommunicationAgent)

### Grid Security Continuous Monitoring
This project looks at techniques to evaluate the effectiveness of attack detection strategies in in a network by producing a quantitative score based on the various monitoring capabilities available (e.g., IDS, netflow, syslog).

More to come soon!!

### DER/IoT Risk Analysis 
This work is exploring the cybersecurity risks of the emerging IoT and Smart Grid nexus, and requires analysis methods that expand beyond current practice to address the large-scale nature of these environments and increased risk of consumer environments. 

More to come soon!!

### Blockchains/Smart Contracts for Power Systems
This project is exploring how to best use blockchains and smart contracts within power systems to enable the coordination and consensus among distributed energy resources and enabling increased penetration of renewable energy. 

More to come soon!!
